# Case-Based Writing

Transform abstract principles into compelling narratives by grounding them in specific human cases. Based on Atul Gawande's methodology as a New Yorker staff writer.

---

## When to Use

- Writing feels abstract or theoretical
- Need to make data emotionally compelling
- Readers aren't engaging with important concepts
- Explaining complex systems or processes
- Want to show rather than tell

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "My writing feels abstract"
- "How do I make data compelling?"
- "It's too theoretical"
- "Readers aren't engaging"
- "I need to humanize this"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| principle | Yes | The abstract concept or insight to communicate |
| audience | No | Who you're writing for |
| available_cases | No | Specific examples you have access to |
| format | No | Article, report, presentation, etc. |

## Core Principle

> Every principle needs a person. Not data—a person.
> — Methodology of Atul Gawande

Gawande doesn't write: "Surgical errors occur at a rate of X%."
He writes: "Mrs. Williams came in for a routine procedure on a Tuesday morning. By Thursday, she was in the ICU."

The case makes the abstract concrete, the statistic human, the principle memorable.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify Your Core Insight

Before finding a case, be clear about the principle:
- What's the essential truth you're communicating?
- What should readers understand or believe after reading?
- What action or change in thinking do you want?

**Example:** "Checklists prevent errors even among experts" is clearer than "quality improvement is important."

### Step 2: Find the Right Case

The ideal case:
- **Illustrates the principle specifically** (not just related to it)
- **Has human stakes** (someone's life, livelihood, or wellbeing)
- **Has concrete details** (names, dates, places, specifics)
- **Has a resolution** (what happened as a result)

**Where to find cases:**
- Your own experience
- Interviews with people who've lived the principle
- Published accounts (with attribution)
- Composite cases (clearly labeled as such)

### Step 3: Open with the Case

Don't start with the principle. Start with the person.

**Not this:**
"Checklists are important in surgery because they reduce complications. Consider the following case..."

**This:**
"On a Tuesday morning in January, Mrs. Williams was wheeled into Operating Room 4 for what should have been a routine procedure..."

Ground the reader in the moment before explaining why it matters.

### Step 4: Build the Scene

Make it vivid:
- **Sensory details** - What did it look like, sound like?
- **Specific timing** - Tuesday morning, 3pm, during the surgery
- **Concrete actions** - Not "a complication occurred" but "the monitor began alarming"
- **Human reactions** - What did people feel, say, do?

### Step 5: Reveal the Principle Through the Case

Now connect the story to the larger truth:
- What does this case show?
- What's the mechanism that explains what happened?
- How does this generalize?

The principle emerges from the case, not the reverse.

### Step 6: Return to the Human

End by coming back to the person:
- What happened to them?
- What changed because of this case?
- What's at stake for others like them?

The reader should remember the person, not just the principle.

## The Gawande Structure

| Section | Content | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Opening** | Specific case, vivid detail | Hook reader, create stakes |
| **Development** | Build the story, add context | Create tension, show complexity |
| **Turn** | Reveal the principle | Connect story to larger truth |
| **Evidence** | Data, research, additional cases | Prove the principle generalizes |
| **Return** | Back to original case | Emotional resonance, closure |

## Before and After

**Abstract version:**
"Research shows that checklists reduce surgical complications by 36% and deaths by 47%. Medical teams should implement them."

**Case-based version:**
"Mrs. Williams was 62, a retired teacher who came to the hospital for a procedure her surgeon had done hundreds of times. But that morning, three small things were missed: the antibiotic was given late, the patient's allergy wasn't confirmed, and no one checked if the blood type was on hand.

By Thursday, Mrs. Williams was in the ICU with a systemic infection. By Sunday, she was dead.

A checklist—nineteen items, taking less than two minutes—would have caught all three errors. In hospitals that use such checklists, complications fall by 36 percent. Deaths fall by 47 percent.

Mrs. Williams's surgeon knew everything on that checklist. He was skilled, experienced, careful. But memory is unreliable, especially under pressure. The human brain cannot consistently hold nineteen items across hundreds of procedures.

The checklist isn't an insult to expertise. It's a recognition that expertise has limits—and those limits cost lives."

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "I'm writing about why our company needs to invest in employee development. I have data on retention and performance, but it feels dry."

**Case-Based Writing response:**

You don't need more data. You need a person.

**Step 1: What's your principle?**
"Companies that invest in employee development retain better people and get better results."

That's abstract. Let's find a person who makes it real.

**Step 2: Find your case**

Think of:
- An employee who left because they weren't developed—what happened to them and the company?
- An employee who stayed and grew because of investment—what's their story?
- A team that transformed after a development program

**Example case:** "Marcus joined as a junior analyst three years ago. He was smart but raw. His first manager invested two hours a week in his development—reviewing his work, teaching him frameworks, giving him stretch projects. Today Marcus leads our most important client relationship. Last quarter, he saved a $2M account that was about to leave. That $2M almost didn't happen—Marcus nearly left eighteen months ago for a competitor offering 20% more. He stayed because his manager had invested in him."

**Step 3: Open with Marcus**

"In September 2023, Marcus Chen sat in his car in our parking lot, holding a job offer from a competitor. The offer was 20% more than he was making. He had every reason to take it.

He didn't. Last quarter, the client relationship he now leads brought in $2 million that would have gone to that same competitor.

The difference between losing Marcus and keeping him came down to something that happens in a conference room on Tuesday mornings: his manager spends two hours developing him."

**Step 4: Build out**
- What does that Tuesday meeting look like?
- What did Marcus learn?
- What would have happened if he'd left?

**Step 5: Connect to principle**
Now bring in your data: "Marcus isn't unique. Across our company, employees whose managers invest development time stay 3x longer and perform 40% better..."

**Step 6: Return to Marcus**
End with what Marcus is doing now, what he's going to do next, what he'll mean to the company.

Your leadership will remember Marcus long after they forget the retention statistics.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **hard-conversation-framework** - Telling difficult truths through story
- **scene-over-summary** (Robert Caro) - Similar technique from different expert
- **positive-deviance-analysis** - Cases of people who succeed differently

---

## Constraints

- Cases must be true or clearly labeled as composite/hypothetical
- Privacy considerations—get permission or anonymize
- Case must actually illustrate the principle (not just be interesting)
- Balance emotion and evidence
